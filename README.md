# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock (Racket)

This project implements the **Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock** game, inspired by the popular TV show *The Big Bang Theory*. It was created for a **Programming Languages Principles** course, where we explore different programming paradigms and work with "dead" or esoteric languages. This implementation is done in **Racket** (`.rkt`), a dialect of Scheme, demonstrating functional programming concepts.

## Game Rules

The game extends the classic **Rock-Paper-Scissors** by adding two additional elements: **Lizard** and **Spock**, as introduced in *The Big Bang Theory*. The rules are as follows:

- **Rock** crushes **Scissors**.
- **Scissors** cuts **Paper**.
- **Paper** covers **Rock**.
- **Rock** crushes **Lizard**.
- **Lizard** poisons **Spock**.
- **Spock** smashes **Scissors**.
- **Scissors** decapitates **Lizard**.
- **Lizard** eats **Paper**.
- **Paper** disproves **Spock**.
- **Spock** vaporizes **Rock**.

The goal of the game is to select one of the five options and beat your opponent's selection according to these rules.

## Features

- Implemented the game logic using **Racket** and functional programming principles.
- Handled user input and game flow within the terminal.
- Displayed results (win/loss/tie) based on the players' choices.
- Utilized basic data structures (lists, conditionals) to manage the game's rules.

## Installation & Running the Program

To run this project, you'll need **Racket** installed on your machine. Follow these steps:

1. Install Racket from the official site: [https://racket-lang.org/](https://racket-lang.org/).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JaydenCruz/rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock-rkt.git
